;;; Commentary:

;; This package runs CMake and sets variables for on the fly syntax checking
;; and auto-completion using clang.

;;; Usage:

;; (cmake-ide-setup)
;
; If cmake-ide-flags-c or cmake-ide-flags-c++ are set, they will be added to ac-clang-flags.
; These variables should be set. Particularly, they should contain the system include paths.
;
;;; Code:

(require 'json)
(require 'auto-complete-clang)
(require 'flycheck)
