;;; Commentary:

;; This package runs CMake and sets variables for IDE-like functionality
;; provided by other packages such as:
;; On the fly syntax checks with flycheck
;; auto-completion using auto-complete-clang or company-clang
;; Jump to definition and refactoring with rtags
;; These other packages must be installed for the functionality to work

;;; Usage:

;; (cmake-ide-setup)
;;
;; If cmake-ide-flags-c or cmake-ide-flags-c++ are set, they will be added to ac-clang-flags.
;; These variables should be set. Particularly, they should contain the system include paths.
;;
